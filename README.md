MeasureJS
=============
MeasureJS is a javascript library which allow you to measure execution time of your code. The style of writing
measurement suits is similar to those which you are able to write in qunit. Thanks to MeasureJS-UI you are able
to navigate through them in user friendly UI, rerun dynamically, change the number of executions loop and compare
them together.
